Further Reading
===============

Polycirc is an implementation of the *differentiable polynomial circuits* of
:cite:t:`polycirc`
using the hypergraph-based datastructure of
`yarrow-diagrams <https://github.com/yarrow-id/diagrams>`_
which is described in :cite:t:`dpafsd`.

*Differentiability* of polynomial circuits is based the paper :cite:t:`rdc`;
a detailed graphical explanation can be found in :cite:t:`polycirc`.
